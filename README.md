I transformed a design from Figma and completed tasks from Trello, which included necessary functionalities for the website, as part of a two-week internship program.

Initially, I developed the project using Vanilla JS. After completing that phase, I transformed my Vanilla JS application into a React (Hooks) application, keeping the same design and functionalities.

**Features**: 

 - Responsive design
 - Image slider (Swiper)
 - Hamburger menu 
 - Dark/Light mode
 - Popup message 
 - Parallax scrolling effect
 - Loading brands and products from a JSON file.

**Technologies**: React (Hooks)/JS, SCSS (Gulp)/CSS, Swiper.js.
